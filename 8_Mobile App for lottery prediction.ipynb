Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities."
